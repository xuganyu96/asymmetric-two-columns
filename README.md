# Jekyll resume theme
Separate resume formatting/theming from content to simplify the resume writing process. You can write your resume with YAML!

## Project structure
* The global layouts of the resume (rows, columns, responsiveness) are stored under `_layouts`
* The individual components (name, contacts, education, etc.) are stored under `_includes`
* The content can be stored in a page front matter (like with `index.html`, if you want each page to display a different resume) or in the global configuration `_config.yaml` file
